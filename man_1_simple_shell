.SH NAME

Simple Shell \- command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B [no options included]
.br
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBSimple Shell\fR is a custom variation of a basic UNIX shell, a minimalist approach in its design and development.
The \fBSimple Shell\fR allows the user to enter commands. These are then interpreted and executed by the operating system.
Its design, compilation, and testing were carried out in an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

.SH UTILISATION

Use the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) to compile hsh with the additional flags below:

.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

.B - Interactive mode:

.PP
The \fBhsh\fR works by taking user input on the terminal after pressing the enter key.
Note that the prompt ($) will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by enter key.

.B ($) ./hsh

.B (is_hsh$) ls -l

.B - Non-interactive mode:

.PP
Users can specify shell scripts to be executed by \fBhsh\fR usually through the use of pipes '|'.

.B ($) echo \/"ls -l\/" | ./hsh

.SH EXECUTABLES

.PP
If the first character of the command is a slash (/), the hsh search for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.

.B ($) /bin/pwd

.B /Users/username/Documents/HOLBERTON

.B ($)

.PP
If not then the hsh will search in the user PATH environment if the command exist.

.B ($) pwd

.B /Users/username/Documents/HOLBERTON

.B ($)

.SH BUILTINS

The following builtin commands are supported:

.B exit
- exits the program

.B env
- prints the environment variables

.SH RETURN VALUE

\fBhsh\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and other number indicating failure.

All builtins return 0 on success and NULL on failure (indicated by a corresponding error message).

.SH BUGS

None known.
